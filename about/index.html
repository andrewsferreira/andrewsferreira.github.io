<p>With 10 years of experience in technology and almost 5 years dedicated to Information Security, I have worked in various areas, gaining specialized skills. <em>My main activities include</em>:</p>
<p><strong>CyberSec Analyst (Security Operation Center - SOC)</strong>: I conducted continuous monitoring of systems and networks, <em>identifying threats and security incidents</em>. I analyzed logs, responded swiftly to incidents, mitigated attacks, and produced detailed reports on critical events.</p>
<p><strong>CyberSec Analyst (Pentester)</strong>: I performed penetration tests (pentests) on networks, systems, and web applications, identifying vulnerabilities and proposing solutions to mitigate them. Additionally, I conducted attack simulations to assess the resilience of environments and produced technical reports with detected vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation.</p>
<p><strong>Information Security Specialist (Security Architecture and AppSec)</strong>: I&rsquo;m responsible for defining and implementing security policies in systems and applications, integrating security practices into the development lifecycle (DevSecOps). I evaluated software and infrastructure architectures to ensure compliance with standards and best practices, mitigating risks from the design phase.</p>
